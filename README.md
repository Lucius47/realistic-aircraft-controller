Aircraft Controller Demo (Joystick)
 
Unity Version: 2019.4.21f1 LTS

Physics based simulation of an aircraft.
- Aircraft controlled by roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust axes; similar to a real aircraft.
- More aircrafts can be added.
- Properties suchs as drag and lift coefficients, wings area etc will be added eventually.

# Keyboard Controls:

Thrust: W (increase), S (decrease)

Pitch: page up (nose down), page down (nose up)

Roll: A (roll left), D (roll right)

Yaw: Q (yaw left), E (yaw right)

# Joystick Controls:

Thrust: DPAD Vertical (Axis #7)

Pitch: Vertical Axis (Y-axis)

Roll: Horizontal Axis (X-axis)

Yaw: left Trigger (yaw left), right trigger (yaw right)
